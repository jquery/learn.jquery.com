## introduction

This package exposes both a cli tool and an npm package to parse the
content of this website, and generates jsfiddle-ready gists.

## synopsis

    rake fiddle
    # or
    nanoc compile && cd fiddles/ && ./bin/fiddles

## install

    cd fiddles/
    npm install

Or, to link the package as a `fiddles` executable:

    cd fiddles/
    npm link

`fiddles` would then be available in your `$PATH`.

## configuration
 
These are the options available to further configure the build script.
Ideally, each of these would be overridable by cli usage.

* source: source folder (where the markdown files are), defaults to
  `./content`.
* pages: regex matching the pages the build will handle, defaults to
  `/exercises.md$/`.  The pages regex is used to filter the markdown
files to process.
* use: regex matching the patterns used in pages to specifiy the
  exercises html file, defaults to /Use the file `(.+)`/.
* open: regex matching the patterns used in pages to specify the
  exercises js file, defaults to /Open the file `(.+)`/.
* output: location of the gist/jsfiddle generated folder, defaults to
  `content/fiddles`. This folder should be .gitignored since it'll be
full of git repository.
* host: default to `http://learn.jquery.com`. url of the live site, used
  during generation process to replace relative img references to
absolute ones.
* assets: defaults to `/images/` related to host option above. Image
  assets assume host/assets is where they'll be hosted so gists
generated try loading them from there.

## workflow

These are the different tasks the build script handles in the order they happen:

* parse: parse the content of markdown files ending with `exercises.md`
  (options.pages) and search for any `Use the file`/`Open the file`
patterns.  The parsing process builds a hash object of useful meta
infos, like the exercises title, the content of exercises page and their
path.

* generate: from these meta information, generates according
  jsfiddles-ready gists, at the likely location of configuration
`output` options. From there, two options:
  * The gist is a new one, first time generation. The script should
    handle the creation of the gist (using
[ngist](https://github.com/chapel/ngist) probably).
  * The gist folder already exists and is a valid git repo. The script
    should be able to handle the edition of the gist (git add/commit)
and push the new content.
  * This step is probably the trickier one, have to be done right (and
    we'll probably have to handle a "gist dictionary", where gists once
created edit a configuration file, maybe just package.json). The idea
here is that with a new fres repo clone, one would be able to clone the
previously created gists, and don't generate/push new ones but rather
re-use intelligently the gist previously created.

* replace: once generation done, the script should edit and replace
  content in original markdown files (or on the generated html files?).
If the gists repo have been created, the script could probably get
sensitive information about the gist repository (remote url). From that,
the script should compute the corresponding jsFiddle URL, add the link
at proper place in exercises pages, and append the embedding gist
script.
