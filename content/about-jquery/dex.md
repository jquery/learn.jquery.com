title: About jQuery
---


jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in the world that eases the lives of developers by allowing them to "Write Less, Do More". jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

jQuery has been built on top of a plugin architecture, which allows developers to take plugins (code that accomplishes a specific task) and use them in their projects with only a few lines of code. While the official jQuery plugins site is under construction, feel free to browse around the [archived site](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/) or [search on github](https://github.com/search/) to find plugins.

For more information about jQuery as a whole, check out the [core team](http://jquery.org/team) behind it and the [history of jQuery](http://jquery.org/history). Also, feel free to familiarize yourself with the [license](http://jquery.org/license) or [donate](http://jquery.org/donate) to the project!
