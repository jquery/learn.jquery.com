As your work with jQuery progresses, you'll find that there's often data about
an element that you want to store with the element.  In plain JavaScript, you
might do this by adding a property to the DOM element, but you'd have to deal
with memory leaks in some browsers.  jQuery offers a straightforward way to
store data related to an element, and it manages the memory issues for you.

<javascript caption="Storing and retrieving data related to an element">
$('#myDiv').data('keyName', { foo : 'bar' });
$('#myDiv').data('keyName'); // { foo : 'bar' }
</javascript>

You can store any kind of data on an element, and it's hard to overstate the
importance of this when you get into complex application development.  For the
purposes of this class, we'll mostly use `$.fn.data` to store references to
other elements.

For example, we may want to establish a relationship between a list item and a
div that's inside of it.  We could establish this relationship every single
time we interact with the list item, but a better solution would be to
establish the relationship once, and then store a pointer to the div on the
list item using `$.fn.data`:

<javascript caption="Storing a relationship between elements using $.fn.data">
$('#myList li').each(function() {
  var $li = $(this), $div = $li.find('div.content');
  $li.data('contentDiv', $div);
});

// later, we don't have to find the div again;
// we can just read it from the list item's data
var $firstLi = $('#myList li:first');
$firstLi.data('contentDiv').html('new content');
</javascript>

In addition to passing `$.fn.data` a single key-value pair to store data, you can also pass an object containing one or more pairs.
