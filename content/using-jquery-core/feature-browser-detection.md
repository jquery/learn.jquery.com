## Feature & Browser Detection

Although jQuery eliminates most JavaScript browser quirks, there are still
occasions when your code needs to know about the browser environment.

jQuery offers the `$.support` object, as well as the deprecated $.browser
object, for this purpose.  For complete documentation on these objects, visit
[$.support documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/) and
[$.browser support on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/).

The `$.support` object is dedicated to determining what features a browser
supports; it is recommended as a more “future-proof” method of customizing your
JavaScript for different browser environments.

The `$.browser` object was deprecated in favor of the `$.support` object, but
it will not be removed from jQuery anytime soon. It provides direct detection
of the browser brand and version.
