Depending on your level of experience with some of the workflows common to many
open source projects, e.g. git/GitHub, the command line, and setting up a
local development environment, contributing to this site may be a breeze or
come with a bit of a learning curve. If you fit into the former group, great!
Jump ahead to learn how to get started.

But if you think you're part of the second group, and have had trouble
participating in open source because of a lack of comfort with the tools,
**you're still welcome**! Beyond providing a resource for learning jQuery, a
major goal of this site is to provide an encouraging environment for you to
develop these skills, while still making a contribution that matters. Many
people think that the only way to get involved with a programming project like
jQuery is to solve intricate bugs that require a nuanced understanding of the
codebase, or to propose enhancements that may or may not be in scope with the
development team's plans. The fact is that there's way more: improving
documentation, working on web properties, and supporting other users are
crucial aspects where more help is always needed. If you're willing to share
your time and expertise to help other developers, we're willing to [help you
get up to speed with the tools](#getting-help) you'll need.


## Why Contribute?

If you've ever looked for help with jQuery -- or with web development in
general -- you know the hunt can sometimes be challenging. It's can be a
process of wading through a number of different posts until you find that
article that's the right combination of trustworthy, timely, and helpful for
your particular problem.  And if you're one of those authors -- thanks! -- then
you are probably familiar with the frustrating feeling of putting a useful tip
out there, and then wondering if it's actually making its way to the people who
need it, and what to do with that old post years and versions down the road.
You're invited to share that energy to help us bring that ecosystem together
and grow it further!

If you've ever helped anyone, colleague or stranger, with a particular problem,
then you know the value of having a reference you can quickly link to that says
"here's how you do it." This site is intended to be that compendium, but
there's always more to refine and add, and we need your help too!

Of course, we'll also give you credit for your work! The **Contributors** section
for each article is generated from the git commit logs on the file, so you'll
be publicly acknowledged for your help.

## How Does It Work?

### Content

The content in this site is maintained in
[this GitHub repository](http://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com) as a collection of
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files in the `page`
directory. The order in which chapters and articles are presented is controlled
by the [order.yml](https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/master/order.yml)
file.

### Design

The site's layout and design is controlled by our
[`jquery-wp-content`](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content), a custom
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) configuration that runs (or will run in the
near future) all of the sites run by the jQuery Foundation. The [master
theme](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/master/themes/jquery)
controls most of the layout for all of our sites, and there is a [child
theme](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/master/themes/learn.jquery.com)
that controls the templates and styles specific to the learn site.

[`jquery-wp-content`](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content) powers our sites in
production and staging environments, and can set up for local development relatively easily.

### Build

The static content in the `page` directory is deployed to a
[`jquery-wp-content`](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content) instance
using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com), specifically with two grunt plugins we've created:

* [grunt-jquery-content](http://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content) - pre-processes content in a variety of formats (HTML, Markdown, XML) into HTML, applying syntax highlighting and some simple partial support, preparing it for processing by
* [grunt-wordpress](http://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress) - syncs static content to WordPress using [XML-RPC](http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support)


## How Can I Help?

The simplest and least complicated way to help is to [file
issues](http://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues) if you notice
mistakes that should be fixed, improvements that can be made, or if you have
ideas for new articles. We'll use the issues to continue discussion and track
progress on anything you point out.

If you'd like to go a step further and contribute new articles, make edits to
existing ones, or work on the site itself, the first thing you'll need is a
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). When you have changes
you'd like to have reviewed for integration into the site, submit a [pull
request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).

*(If you're unfamiliar with Git, you can still contribute by using features in
GitHub's web UI. You can edit files directly via [GitHub's in-browser
editor](https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace). You can [create and
delete branches directly from your
fork](https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branches), so you can also
submit new articles as well. Either way, we still encourage you to [learn how
to use Git and GitHub](http://help.github.com/) as soon as you can.)*

## Local Development

In order to preview your changes locally, work on design/layout issues, or work
on other jQuery sites' content, and generally contribute most effectively, we
recommend that you set up a local development environment. You can learn how to
get set up from our [documentation on contributing to jQuery Foundation web
sites](http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#local-development).

* **Windows note:** Line endings need to be Unix-style (line-feed only). Make
  sure your text editor creates new files with Unix-style line endings. In
  addition, the following setting to your git config will keep the Unix-style
  line endings when pulling from the repository.*

```
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

### Working With Content

Once you've gotten your environment working, here are the general steps you should follow to make your changes:

1. Create a new "feature" branch based on `master` -- `git branch <feature/issue name/number>`
2. Move onto that branch -- `git checkout <feature/issue name/number>`
3. Work on your awesome contribution.
4. As you work and want to preview your changes, use `grunt` to deploy them to the your site. You can also use `grunt watch` to have the site monitor the `page` directory for any changes and automatically have the changes deployed every time you save.
5. When you're done, stage the new/modified preparation for commit -- `git add page/faq/how-do-i-add-a-new-article-to-the-learn-site.md`
6. Commit the files to your local repo -- `git commit -m "add a relevant message describing the change"`
7. Push the files to your GitHub remote -- `git push origin <feature/issue name/number>`
8. Go to your fork on GitHub and submit a new [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

For more advice on managing your fork and submitting pull requests to jQuery
Foundation, read our [Commits and Pull
Requests](http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/) guide.

### Adding A New Article

1. Add the file to the right folder in the page folder.
2. Add the slug name (the filename without the extension) to the desired location `order.yml`
3. Run `grunt`
4. You should now be able to navigate to the file.

### Formatting Articles

Yes! Take a look at our [style guide](http://learn.jquery.com/style-guide) for
more information on authoring and formatting conventions.

## How Will My Contribution Be Acknowledged?

We will build the attribution of an article based on the git commit logs and present this information in the site.

## <a name="getting-help">Getting Help</a>

If you're struggling to get any part of the site working properly, or have any questions, we're here to help.

The best place to get help is on [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), in the #jquery-content
channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net). If you're unfamiliar with IRC, you can use the [webchat gateway](http://webchat.freenode.net/).

In addition, the jQuery Content Team holds a [public, weekly
meetings](http://jquery.org/meeting) on Freenode, at 1PM Eastern time in the #jquery-meeting channel.

If IRC is not your thing, but you still want or need to get in touch, please use the site's GitHub repo or send us an e-mail to `content at jquery dot org`.
