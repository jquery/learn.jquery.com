##ABOUT BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

jQuery actively supports these browsers:

[Firefox Current](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) - 1 version
[Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/) 6+
[Safari Current](http://www.apple.com/safari/) - 1 version
[Opera Current](http://www.opera.com/browser/) - 1 version
[Chrome Current](http://www.google.com/chrome/) - 1 version
Any problem with them should be considered and reported as a bug in jQuery.

There are known problems with:

Mozilla Firefox 1.0.x
Internet Explorer 1.0-5.x
Safari 1.0-2.0.1
Opera 1.0-9.x
Konqueror

jQuery generally works with Konqueror and Firefox 1.0.x, but there may be some unexpected bugs since we do not test them as regularly.
