While jQuery does offer many Ajax-related convenience methods, the core
`$.ajax()` method is at the heart of all of them, and understanding it is
imperative.  We'll review it first, and then touch briefly on the convenience
methods.

As you'll see, the `$.ajax()` method offers features that the convenience
methods do not, along with a syntax that is more explicit, though also more
verbose.

### `$.ajax()`

jQuery’s core `$.ajax()` method is a powerful and straightforward way of creating
Ajax requests. It takes a configuration object that contains all the
instructions jQuery requires to complete the request. The `$.ajax()` method is
particularly valuable because it offers the ability to specify both success and
failure callbacks. Also, its ability to take a configuration object that can
be defined separately makes it easier to write reusable code. For complete
documentation of the configuration options, visit
[http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ "$.ajax
documentation on api.jquery.com").

```
// Using the core $.ajax() method
$.ajax({
	// the URL for the request
	url: "post.php",

	// the data to send (will be converted to a query string)
	data: {
		id: 123
	},

	// whether this is a POST or GET request
	type: "GET",

	// the type of data we expect back
	dataType : "json",

	// code to run if the request succeeds;
	// the response is passed to the function
	success: function( json ) {
		$( "<h1/>" ).text( json.title ).appendTo( "body" );
		$( "<div class=\"content\"/>").html( json.html ).appendTo( "body" );
	},

	// code to run if the request fails; the raw request and
	// status codes are passed to the function
	error: function( xhr, status ) {
		alert( "Sorry, there was a problem!" );
	},

	// code to run regardless of success or failure
	complete: function( xhr, status ) {
		alert( "The request is complete!" );
	}
});
```

**Note:** A note about the `dataType` setting: if the server sends back data that is in a
different format than you specify, your code may fail, and the reason will not
always be clear, because the HTTP response code will not show an error. When
working with Ajax requests, make sure your server is sending back the data type
you're asking for, and verify that the `Content-type` header is accurate for the
data type. For example, for JSON data, the `Content-type` header should be
`application/json`.

### `$.ajax()` Options

There are many, many options for the `$.ajax()` method, which is part of its
power.  For a complete list of options, visit
[http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ "$.ajax
documentation on api.jquery.com"); here are several that you will use
frequently:

#### async

Set to `false` if the request should be sent synchronously. Defaults to `true`.
Note that if you set this option to `false`, your request will block execution
of other code until the response is received.

#### cache

Whether to use a cached response if available. Defaults to `true` for all
`dataType`s except "script" and "jsonp". When set to `false`, the URL will simply
have a cachebusting parameter appended to it.

#### complete

A callback function to run when the request is complete, regardless of success
or failure. The function receives the raw request object and the text status of
the request.

#### context

The scope in which the callback function(s) should run (i.e. what `this` will
mean inside the callback function(s)). By default, `this` inside the callback
function(s) refers to the object originally passed to `$.ajax()`.

#### data

The data to be sent to the server. This can either be an object or a query
string, such as `foo=bar&amp;baz=bim`.

#### dataType

The type of data you expect back from the server. By default, jQuery will look
at the MIME type of the response if no `dataType` is specified.

#### error

A callback function to run if the request results in an error. The function
receives the raw request object and the text status of the request.

#### jsonp

The callback name to send in a query string when making a JSONP request.
Defaults to "callback".

#### success

A callback function to run if the request succeeds. The function receives the
response data (converted to a JavaScript object if the `dataType` was JSON), as
well as the text status of the request and the raw request object.

#### timeout

The time in milliseconds to wait before considering the request a failure.

#### traditional

Set to `true` to use the param serialization style in use prior to jQuery 1.4.
For details, see
[http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
"$.param documentation on api.jquery.com").

#### type

The type of the request, "POST" or "GET". Defaults to "GET". Other request
types, such as "PUT" and "DELETE" can be used, but they may not be supported by
all browsers.

#### url

The URL for the request.

The `url` option is the only required property of the `$.ajax()` configuration
object; all other properties are optional. This can also be passed as the first
argument to `$.ajax()`, and the options object as the second argument.

### Convenience Methods

If you don't need the extensive configurability of `$.ajax()`, and you don't care
about handling errors, the Ajax convenience functions provided by jQuery can be
useful, terse ways to accomplish Ajax requests.  These methods are just
"wrappers" around the core `$.ajax()` method, and simply pre-set some of the
options on the `$.ajax()` method.

The convenience methods provided by jQuery are:

#### $.get

Perform a GET request to the provided URL.

#### $.post

Perform a POST request to the provided URL.

#### $.getScript

Add a script to the page.

#### $.getJSON

Perform a GET request, and expect JSON to be returned.

In each case, the methods take the following arguments, in order:

#### url

The URL for the request. Required.

#### data

The data to be sent to the server. Optional. This can either be an object or a
query string, such as `foo=bar&amp;baz=bim`.

**Note:** This option is not valid for `$.getScript`.

#### success callback

A callback function to run if the request succeeds. Optional. The function
receives the response data (converted to a JavaScript object if the data type
was JSON), as well as the text status of the request and the raw request
object.

#### data type

The type of data you expect back from the server. Optional.

**Note:** This option is only applicable for methods that don't already specify the data
type in their name.

```
// Using jQuery's Ajax convenience methods

// get plain text or HTML
$.get( "/users.php", {
	userId: 1234
}, function( resp ) {
	console.log( resp ); // server response
});

// add a script to the page, then run a function defined in it
$.getScript( "/static/js/myScript.js", function() {
	functionFromMyScript();
});

// get JSON-formatted data from the server
$.getJSON( "/details.php", function( resp ) {
	// log each key in the response data
	$.each( resp, function( key, value ) {
		console.log( key + " : " + value );
	});
});
```

### `$.fn.load`

The `.load()` method is unique among jQuery’s Ajax methods in that it is
called on a selection.  The `.load()` method fetches HTML from a URL, and
uses the returned HTML to populate the selected element(s).  In addition to
providing a URL to the method, you can optionally provide a selector; jQuery
will fetch only the matching content from the returned HTML.

```
// Using $.fn.load to populate an element
$( "#newContent" ).load( "/foo.html" );
```

```
// Using $.fn.load to populate an element based on a selector
$( "#newContent" ).load( "/foo.html #myDiv h1:first:", function( html ) {
	alert( "Content updated!" );
});
```
