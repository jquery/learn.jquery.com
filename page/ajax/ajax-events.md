Often, you'll want to perform an operation whenever an Ajax requests starts or
stops, such as showing or hiding a loading indicator. Rather than defining
this behavior inside every Ajax request, you can bind Ajax events to elements
just like you'd bind other events. For a complete list of Ajax events, visit
[Ajax Events documentation on docs.jquery.com](http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events).

```
// Setting up a loading indicator using Ajax Events
$( "#loading_indicator" ).ajaxStart(function() {
	$( this ).show();
}).ajaxStop(function() {
	$( this ).hide();
});
```
