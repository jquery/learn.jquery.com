title   : Increasing Performance with Event Delegation

You'll frequently use jQuery to add new elements to the page, and when you do,
you may need to bind events to those new elements â€” events you already bound to
similar elements that were on the page originally.  Instead of repeating your
event binding every time you add elements to the page, you can use event
delegation.  With event delegation, you bind your event to a container element,
and then when the event occurs, you look to see which contained element it
occurred on.  If this sounds complicated, luckily jQuery makes it easy with its
`$.fn.live` and `$.fn.delegate` methods.

While most people discover event delegation while dealing with elements added
to the page later, it has some performance benefits even if you never add more
elements to the page.  The time required to bind event handlers to hundreds of
individual elements is non-trivial; if you have a large set of elements, you
should consider delegating related events to a container element.

### Note

The `$.fn.live` method was introduced in jQuery 1.3, and at that time only
certain event types were supported.  As of jQuery 1.4.2, the `$.fn.delegate`
method is available, and is the preferred method.

```
//Event delegation using `$.fn.delegate`

    $('#myUnorderedList').delegate('li', 'click', function(e) {
        var $myListItem = $(this);
        // ...
    });
```

```
//Event delegation using `$.fn.live`
    $('#myUnorderedList li').live('click', function(e) {
        var $myListItem = $(this);
        // ...
    });
```

### Unbinding Delegated Events

If you need to remove delegated events, you can't simply unbind them.  Instead,
use `$.fn.undelegate` for events connected with `$.fn.delegate`, and `$.fn.die`
for events connected with `$.fn.live`.  As with bind, you can optionally pass
in the name of the bound function.
```
//Unbinding delegated events
    $('#myUnorderedList').undelegate('li', 'click');
    $('#myUnorderedList li').die('click');
```
