jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections.
When an event occurs, the provided function is executed. Inside the function,
`this` refers to the element that was clicked.

For details on jQuery events, visit the
[Events documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/).

The event handling function can receive an event object. This object can be
used to determine the nature of the event, and to prevent the eventâ€™s default
behavior.

For details on the event object, visit the
[Event object documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/).
