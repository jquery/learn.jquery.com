jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections. When an event occurs, the provided function is executed. Inside the function, `this` refers to the element that was clicked.

For details on jQuery events, visit the [Events documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/).

The event handling function can receive an event object. This object can be used to determine the nature of the event, and to prevent the event’s default behavior.

For details on the event object, visit the [Event object documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/).
