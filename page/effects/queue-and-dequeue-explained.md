When you use the `animate`, and `show`, `hide`, `slideUp`, etc. effect methods, you're
adding a job to the effects queue. By default, using `queue()` and passing a function,
will add it to the effects queue. So we're creating our own bespoke animation step:

```
$( ".box" ).animate({
	height: 20
}, "slow" ).queue(function() {
	$( "#title" ).html( "We're in the animation, baby!" );
});
```

As I said though, these methods come in pairs, so anything you add using `queue()`,
you need to dequeue to allow the process to continue. In the code above, if I
chained more animations on, until I call `$( this ).dequeue()`, the subsequent
animations wouldn't run:

```
$( ".box" ).animate({
	height: 20
}, "slow" ).queue(function() {
	$( "#title" ).html( "We're in the animation, baby!" );
	$( this ).dequeue();
}).animate({
	height: 150
});
```

Keeping in mind that the animation won't continue until we've explicitly called
`dequeue()`, we can easily create a pausing plugin, by adding a step in the queue
that sets a timer and triggers after `n` milliseconds, at which time, it dequeues
the element:

```
$.fn.pause = function( n ) {
	return this.queue(function() {
		var el = this;
		setTimeout(function() {
			return $( el ).dequeue();
		}, n );
	});
};

$( ".box" ).animate({
	height: 20
}, "slow" ).pause( 1000 ).animate({
	height: 150
});
```

Remember that the first argument for `queue()` and `dequeue()` is `fx`, and that in
all of these examples I'm not including it because jQuery sets the argument to `fx` by default â€” so I don't have to specify it.
