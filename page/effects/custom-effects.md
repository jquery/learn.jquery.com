title   : Custom Effects with $.fn.animate
level: beginner
---
jQuery makes it possible to animate arbitrary CSS properties via the
`$.fn.animate` method.  The `$.fn.animate` method lets you animate to a set
value, or to a value relative to the current value.

```
// Custom effects with `$.fn.animate`">
    $('div.funtimes').animate(
        {
            left : "+=50",
            opacity : 0.25
        },
        300, // duration
        function() { console.log('done!'); // calback
    });
```

<div class="note">
Color-related properties cannot be animated with `$.fn.animate` using jQuery
out of the box.  Color animations can easily be accomplished by including the
[color plugin](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color).  We'll discuss using
plugins later in the book.

### Easing

Definition: Easing describes the manner in which an effect occurs â€” whether
the rate of change is steady, or varies over the duration of the animation.
jQuery includes only two methods of easing: swing and linear.  If you want more
natural transitions in your animations, various easing plugins are available.

As of jQuery 1.4, it is possible to do per-property easing when using the
`$.fn.animate` method.

```
// Per-property easing">
    $('div.funtimes').animate(
        {
            left : [ "+=50", "swing" ],
            opacity : [ 0.25, "linear" ]
        },
        300
    );
```
