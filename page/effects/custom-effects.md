jQuery makes it possible to animate arbitrary CSS properties via the
`.animate()` method. The `.animate()` method lets you animate to a set
value, or to a value relative to the current value.

```
// Custom effects with .animate()
$( "div.funtimes" ).animate({
		left: "+=50",
		opacity: 0.25
	},
	300, // Duration
	function() { // Callback when the animation is finished
		console.log( "done!" );
	}
});
```

**Note:** Color-related properties cannot be animated with `.animate()` using jQuery
out of the box. Color animations can easily be accomplished by including the
[color plugin](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color). We'll discuss using
plugins later in the book.

### Easing

Definition: Easing describes the manner in which an effect occurs â€” whether
the rate of change is steady, or varies over the duration of the animation.
jQuery includes only two methods of easing: swing and linear. If you want more
natural transitions in your animations, various easing plugins are available.

As of jQuery 1.4, it is possible to do per-property easing when using the
`.animate()` method.

```
// Per-property easing
$( "div.funtimes" ).animate({
	left: [ "+=50", "swing" ],
	opacity: [ 0.25, "linear" ]
}, 300 );
```
