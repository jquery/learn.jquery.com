When you use the animate and show, hide, slideUp, etc effect methods, you’re
adding a job on to the fx queue.By default, using queue and passing a function,
will add to the fx queue. So we’re creating our own bespoke animation step:

```
$('.box').animate({
  height : 20
}, 'slow')
.queue(function () {
  $('#title').html("We're in the animation, baby!");
});
```

As I said though, these methods come in pairs, so anything you add using queue,
you need to dequeue to allow the process to continue. In the code above, if I
chained more animations on, until I call $(this).dequeue(), the subsequent
animations wouldn’t run:

```
$('.box').animate({
  height : 20
}, 'slow')
.queue(function () {
  $('#title').html("We're in the animation, baby!");
  $(this).dequeue();
})
.animate({
  height: 150
});
```

Keeping in mind that the animation won’t continue until we’ve explicitly called
dequeue, we can easily create a pausing plugin, by adding a step in the queue
that sets a timer and triggers after n milliseconds, at which time, it dequeues
the element:

```
$.fn.pause = function (n) {
  return this.queue(function () {
    var el = this;
    setTimeout(function () {
      return $(el).dequeue();
    }, n);
  });
};

$('.box').animate({
    height : 20
  }, 'slow')
  .pause(1000) // 1000ms == 1 second
  .animate({
    height: 150
  });
```

Remember that the first argument for queue and dequeue are `fx`, and that in
all of these examples I’m not including it because jQuery set the argument to
`fx` by default - so I don’t have to specify it.
