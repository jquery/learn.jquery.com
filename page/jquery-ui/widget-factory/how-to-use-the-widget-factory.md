title: How To Use the Widget Factory
level: Beginner
---

To start, we’ll create a progress bar that just lets us set the progress
once. As we can see below, this is done by calling `jQuery.widget` with
two parameters: the name of the plugin to create and an object literal
containing functions to support our plugin. When our plugin gets called,
it will create a new plugin instance and all functions will be executed
within the context of that instance. This is different from a standard
jQuery plugin in two important ways. First, the context is an object,
not a DOM element. Second, the context is always a single object, never
a collection.

```
    $.widget( "custom.progressbar", {
        _create: function() {
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element
                .addClass( "progressbar" )
                .text( progress );
        }
    });
```

The name of the plugin must contain a namespace, in this case we’ve used
the `custom` namespace. There is currently a limitation that exactly one
namespace must be used. We can also see that the widget factory has
provided two properties for us. `this.element` is a jQuery object
containing exactly one element. If our plugin is called on a jQuery
object containing multiple elements, a separate plugin instance will be
created for each element, and each instance will have its own
`this.element`. The second property, `this.options`, is a hash
containing key/value pairs for all of our plugin’s options. These
options can be passed to our plugin as shown here.

```
    $( "<div></div>" )
        .appendTo( "body" )
        .progressbar({ value: 20 });
```

When we call `jQuery.widget` it extends jQuery by adding a function to
`jQuery.fn` (the system for creating a standard plugin). The name of the
function it adds is based on the name you pass to `jQuery.widget`,
without the namespace; in our case “progressbar”. The options passed to
our plugin are the values that get set in `this.options` inside of our
plugin instance. As shown below, we can specify default values for any
of our options. When designing your API, you should figure out the most
common use case for your plugin so that you can set appropriate default
values and make all options truly optional.

```
    $.widget( "custom.progressbar", {
        // default options
        options: {
            value: 0
        },
        _create: function() {
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element
                .addClass( "progressbar" )
                .text( progress );
        }
    });
```

### Calling plugin methods

Now that we can initialize our progress bar, we’ll add the ability to
perform actions by calling methods on our plugin instance. To define a
plugin method, we just include the function in the object literal that
we pass to `jQuery.widget`. We can also define “private” methods by
prepending an underscore to the function name.

```
    $.widget( "custom.progressbar", {
        options: {
            value: 0
        },
        _create: function() {
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element
                .addClass( "progressbar" )
                .text( progress );
        },
        // create a public method
        value: function( value ) {
            // no value passed, act as a getter
            if ( value === undefined ) {
                return this.options.value;
            }

            // value passed, act as a setter
            this.options.value = this._constrain( value );
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element.text( progress );
        },
        // create a private method
        _constrain: function( value ) {
            if ( value > 100 ) {
                value = 100;
            }
            if ( value < 0 ) {
                value = 0;
            }
            return value;
        }
    });
```

To call a method on a plugin instance, you pass the name of the method
to the jQuery plugin. If you are calling a method that accepts
parameters, you simply pass those parameters after the method name.

**Note:** Executing methods by passing the method name to the same
jQuery function that was used to initialize the plugin may seem odd.
This is done to prevent pollution of the jQuery namespace while
maintaining the ability to chain method calls. Later in this article
we’ll see alternative uses that may feel more natural.

```
    var bar = $( "<div></div>" )
        .appendTo( "body" )
        .progressbar({ value: 20 });

    // get the current value
    alert( bar.progressbar( "value" ) );

    // update the value
    bar.progressbar( "value", 50 );

    // get the current value again
    alert( bar.progressbar( "value" ) );
```

### Working with options

One of the methods that are automatically available to our plugin is the
`option` method. The `option` method allows you to get and set options
after initialization. This method works exactly like jQuery’s `css` and
`attr` methods: you can pass just a name to use it as a getter, a name
and value to use it as a single setter, or a hash of name/value pairs to
set multiple values. When used as a getter, the plugin will return the
current value of the option that corresponds to the name that was passed
in. When used as a setter, the plugin’s `_setOption` method will be
called for each option that is being set. We can specify a `_setOption`
method in our plugin to react to option changes.
For actions to perform independent of the number of options changed, we
can override `_setOptions`.

```
    $.widget( "custom.progressbar", {
        options: {
            value: 0
        },
        _create: function() {
            this.element.addClass( "progressbar" );
            this.refresh();
        },
        _setOption: function( key, value ) {
            if ( key === "value" ) {
                value = this._constrain( value );
            }
            this._super( key, value );
        },
        _setOptions: function( options ) {
            this._super( options );
            this.refresh();
        },
        refresh: function() {
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element.text( progress );
        },
        _constrain: function( value ) {
            if ( value > 100 ) {
                value = 100;
            }
            if ( value < 0 ) {
                value = 0;
            }
            return value;
        }
    });
```

### Adding callbacks

One of the easiest ways to make your plugin extensible is to add
callbacks so users can react when the state of your plugin changes. We
can see below how to add a callback to our progress bar to signify when
the progress has reached 100%. The `_trigger` method takes three
parameters: the name of the callback, a jQuery event object that
initiated the callback, and a hash of data relevant to the event. The
callback name is the only required parameter, but the others can be very
useful for users who want to implement custom functionality on top of
your plugin. For example, if we were building a draggable plugin, we
could pass the mousemove event when triggering a drag callback;
this would allow users to react to the drag based on the x/y coordinates
provided by the event object. Note that the original event passed to `_trigger`
must be a jQuery event, not a native browser event.

```
    $.widget( "custom.progressbar", {
        options: {
            value: 0
        },
        _create: function() {
            this.element.addClass( "progressbar" );
            this.refresh();
        },
        _setOption: function( key, value ) {
            if ( key === "value" ) {
                value = this._constrain( value );
            }
            this._super( key, value );
        },
        _setOptions: function( options ) {
            this._super( options );
            this.refresh();
        },
        refresh: function() {
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element.text( progress );
            if ( this.options.value == 100 ) {
                this._trigger( "complete", null, { value: 100 } );
            }
        },
        _constrain: function( value ) {
            if ( value > 100 ) {
                value = 100;
            }
            if ( value < 0 ) {
                value = 0;
            }
            return value;
        }
    });
```

Callback functions are essentially just additional options, so you can
get and set them just like any other option. Whenever a callback is
executed, a corresponding event is triggered as well. The event type is
determined by concatenating the plugin name and the callback name. The
callback and event both receive the same two parameters: an event object
and a hash of data relevant to the event, as we’ll see below. Your
plugin may have functionality that you want to allow the user to
prevent. The best way to support this is by creating cancelable
callbacks. User’s can cancel a callback, or its associated event, the
same way they cancel any native event, by calling event.preventDefault()
or returning false. If the user cancels the callback, the `_trigger`
method will return false so you can implement the appropriate
functionality within your plugin.

```
    var bar = $( "<div></div>" )
        .appendTo( "body" )
        .progressbar({
            complete: function( event, data ) {
                alert( "Callbacks are great!" );
            }
        })
        .bind( "progressbarcomplete", function( event, data ) {
            alert( "Events bubble and support many handlers for extreme flexibility." );
            alert( "The progress bar value is " + data.value );
        });

    bar.progressbar( "option", "value", 100 );
```

## Looking under the hood

Now that we’ve seen how to build a plugin using the widget factory,
let’s take a look at how it actually works. When you call
`jQuery.widget`, it creates a constructor for your plugin and sets the
object literal that you pass in as the prototype for your plugin
instances. All of the functionality that automatically gets added to
your plugin comes from a base widget prototype, which is defined as
`jQuery.Widget.prototype`. When a plugin instance is created, it is
stored on the original DOM element using `jQuery.data`, with the plugin
name as the key.

Because the plugin instance is directly linked to the DOM element, you
can access the plugin instance directly instead of going through the
exposed plugin method if you want. This will allow you to call methods
directly on the plugin instance instead of passing method names as
strings and will also give you direct access to the plugin’s properties.

```
    var bar = $( "<div></div>" )
        .appendTo( "body" )
        .progressbar()
        .data( "progressbar" );

    // call a method directly on the plugin instance
    bar.option( "value", 50 );

    // access properties on the plugin instance
    alert( bar.options.value );
```

You can also create an instance without going through the plugin method,
by calling the constructor directly, with the options and element
arguments:

```
    var bar = $.custom.progressbar( {}, $( "<div></div>" ).appendTo( "body") );

    // same result as before
    alert( bar.options.value );
```

### Extending a plugin’s prototype

One of the biggest benefits of having a constructor and prototype for a
plugin is the ease of extending the plugin. By adding or modifying
methods on the plugin’s prototype, we can modify the behavior of all
instances of our plugin. For example, if we wanted to add a method to
our progress bar to reset the progress to 0% we could add this method to
the prototype and it would instantly be available to be called on any
plugin instance.

```
    $.custom.progressbar.prototype.reset = function() {
        this._setOption( "value", 0 );
    };
```

### Cleaning up

In some cases, it will make sense to allow users to apply and then later
unapply your plugin. You can accomplish this via the `_destroy` method.
Within the `_destroy` method, you should undo anything your plugin may
have done during initialization or later use. `_destroy` is called by
the `destroy` method, which is automatically called if the element that your
plugin instance is tied to is removed from the DOM, so this can be used for
garbage collection as well. That base `destroy` method also handles some
general cleanup operations, like removing the instance reference from  the
widget's DOM element, unbinding all events in the widget's namespace from the
element, and unbinding generally all events that were added using `_bind`.

```
    $.widget( "custom.progressbar", {
        options: {
            value: 0
        },
        _create: function() {
            this.element.addClass( "progressbar" );
            this.refresh();
        },
        _setOption: function( key, value ) {
            if ( key === "value" ) {
                value = this._constrain( value );
            }
            this._super( key, value );
        },
        _setOptions: function( options ) {
            this._super( options );
            this.refresh();
        },
        refresh: function() {
            var progress = this.options.value + "%";
            this.element.text( progress );
            if ( this.options.value == 100 ) {
                this._trigger( "complete", null, { value: 100 } );
            }
        },
        _constrain: function( value ) {
            if ( value > 100 ) {
                value = 100;
            }
            if ( value < 0 ) {
                value = 0;
            }
            return value;
        },
        _destroy: function() {
            this.element
                .removeClass( "progressbar" )
                .text( "" );
        }
    });
```

## Closing comments

The widget factory is only one way of creating stateful plugins. There
are a few different models that can be used and each have their own
advantages and disadvantages. The widget factory solves lots of common
problems for you and can greatly improve productivity, it also greatly
improves code reuse, making it a great fit for jQuery UI as well as many
other stateful plugins.

You may have noticed that in this article we used the `custom` namespace. The
`ui` namespace is reserved for official jQuery UI plugins. When building
your own plugins, you should create your own namespace. This makes it
clear where the plugin came from and if it is part of a larger
collection.
