## Exercises

### Selecting

Open the file `/exercises/index.html` in your browser. 
Use the file `/exercises/js/sandbox.js` or work in Firebug to accomplish the following:

1.	Select all of the div elements that have a class of "module".

2.	Come up with three selectors that you could use to get the third item in the #myList unordered list. Which is the best to use? Why?

3.	Select the label for the search input using an attribute selector.

4.	Figure out how many elements on the page are hidden (hint: .length).

5.	Figure out how many image elements on the page have an alt attribute.

6.	Select all of the odd table rows in the table body.

### Traversing

Open the file `/exercises/index.html` in your browser. Use the file `/exercises/js/sandbox.js` or work in Firebug to accomplish the following:

1.	Select all of the image elements on the page; log each image's alt attribute.

2.	Select the search input text box, then traverse up to the form and add a class to the form.

3.	Select the list item inside `#myList` that has a class of "current" and remove that class from it; add a class of "current" to the next list item.

4.	Select the select element inside `#specials`; traverse your way to the submit button.

5.	Select the first list item in the #slideshow element; add the class "current" to it, and then add a class of "disabled" to its sibling elements.

### Manipulating

Open the file `/exercises/index.html` in your browser. Use the file `/exercises/js/sandbox.js` or work in Firebug to accomplish the following:

1.	Add five new list items to the end of the unordered list `#myList`. Hint:

    for (var i = 0; i&lt;5; i++) { ... }

2.	Remove the odd list items

3. 	Add another h2 and another paragraph to the last div.module

4.	Add another option to the select element; give the option the value "Wednesday"

5.	Add a new div.module to the page after the last one; put a copy of one of the existing images inside of it.
