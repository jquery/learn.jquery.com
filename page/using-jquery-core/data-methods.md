There's often data about an element you want to store with the element. In plain JavaScript, you might do this by adding a property to the DOM element, but you'd have to deal with memory leaks in some browsers. jQuery offers a straightforward way to store data related to an element, and it manages the memory issues for you.

```
// Storing and retrieving data related to an element
$("#myDiv").data( "keyName", { foo: "bar" } );

// { foo: "bar" }
$("#myDiv").data("keyName");
```

Any kind of data can be stored on an element. For the purposes of this article, `.data()` will be used to store references to other elements.

For example, you may want to establish a relationship between a list item and a `<div>` that's inside of it. This relationship could be established every single time the list item is touched, but a better solution would be to establish the relationship once, then store a pointer to the `<div>` on the list item using `.data()`:

```
// Storing a relationship between elements using .data()
$("#myList li").each(function() {

  var $li = $( this );
  var $div = $li.find("div.content");

  $li.data( "contentDiv", $div );

});

// later, we don't have to find the div again;
// we can just read it from the list item's data
var $firstLi = $("#myList li:first");

$firstLi.data("contentDiv").html("new content");
```

In addition to passing `.data()` a single key-value pair to store data, you can also pass an object containing one or more pairs.
