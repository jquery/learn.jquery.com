Objects contain one or more key-value pairs. The key portion can be any string. The value portion can be any type of value: a number, a string, an array, a function, or even another object.  When one of these values is a function, itâ€™s called a method of the object. Otherwise, they are called properties.

As it turns out, nearly everything in JavaScript is an object &#8212; arrays, functions, numbers, even strings &#8212; and they all have properties and methods.

```
// Creating an object literal
var myObject = {

  sayHello : function() {

    console.log("hello");

  },

  myName : "Rebecca"

};

myObject.sayHello();            // logs "hello"

console.log( myObject.myName );   // logs "Rebecca"
```

When creating object literals, note that the key portion of each key-value pair can be written as any valid JavaScript identifier, a string (wrapped in quotes), or a number:

```
// test
var myObject = {
  validIdentifier : 123,
  "some string" : 456,
  99999 : 789
};
```
