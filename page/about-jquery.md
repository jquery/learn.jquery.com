Getting started with jQuery can be easy or challenging, depending on your experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and programming concepts in general. In addition to these articles, you can read about the [history of jQuery](https://jquery.org/history/) and the [licensing terms](https://jquery.org/license/) that apply to jQuery projects. You can also [make a donation](https://jquery.org/donate/) to help the [jQuery team](https://jquery.org/team/) continue to improve jQuery.
