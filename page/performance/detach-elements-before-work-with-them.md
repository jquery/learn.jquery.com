The DOM is slow; you want to avoid manipulating it as much as possible. jQuery
introduced `.detach()` in version 1.4 to help address this issue, allowing you
to remove an element from the DOM while you work with it.

```
var $table = $("#myTable");
var $parent = $table.parent();

$table.detach();

// ... add lots and lots of rows to table
$parent.append( $table );
```
