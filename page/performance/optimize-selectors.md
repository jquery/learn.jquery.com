Selector optimization is less important than it used to be, as more browsers
implement document.querySelectorAll() and the burden of selection shifts from
jQuery to the browser. However, there are still some tips to keep in mind.

## ID-Based Selectors

Beginning your selector with an ID is always best.

```
// fast
$("#container div.robotarm");

// super-fast
$("#container").find("div.robotarm");
```

The `.find()` approach is faster because the first selection is handled
without going through the Sizzle selector engine â€” ID-only selections are
handled using `document.getElementById()`, which is extremely fast because it is
native to the browser.

## Specificity

Be specific on the right-hand side of your selector, and less specific on the
left.

```
// unoptimized
$("div.data .gonzalez");

// optimized
$(".data td.gonzalez");

```

Use `tag.class` if possible on your right-most selector, and just tag or just
`.class` on the left.

## Avoid excessive specificity.

```
$(".data table.attendees td.gonzalez");

// better: drop the middle if possible
$(".data td.gonzalez");
```

A "flatter" DOM also helps improve selector performance, as the selector engine
has fewer layers to traverse when looking for an element.

## Avoid the Universal Selector

Selections that specify or imply that a match could be found anywhere can be
very slow.

```
$(".buttons > *");  // extremely expensive
$(".buttons").children();  // much better

$(".gender :radio");  // implied universal selection
$(".gender *:radio"); // same thing, explicit now
$(".gender input:radio"); // much better
```
