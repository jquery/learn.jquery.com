## Writing Stateful Plugins with the jQuery UI Widget Factory

While most existing jQuery plugins are stateless — that is, we call them on an element and that is the extent of our interaction with the plugin — there’s a large set of functionality that doesn’t fit into the basic plugin pattern.

In order to fill this gap, jQuery UI has implemented a more advanced plugin system.
The new system manages state, allows multiple functions to be exposed via a single plugin, and provides various extension points.
This system is called the widget factory and is exposed as `jQuery.widget` as part of jQuery UI 1.8; however, it can be used independently of jQuery UI.

To demonstrate the capabilities of the widget factory, we'll build a simple progress bar plugin.

To start, we’ll create a progress bar that just lets us set the progress once.
As we can see below, this is done by calling jQuery.widget with two parameters: the name of the plugin to create and an object literal containing functions to support our plugin.
When our plugin gets called, it will create a new plugin instance and all functions will be executed within the context of that instance.
This is different from a standard jQuery plugin in two important ways.
First, the context is an object, not a DOM element.
Second, the context is always a single object, never a collection.

A simple, stateful plugin using the jQuery UI widget factory
```
$.widget( "nmk.progressbar", {

  _create: function() {

    var progress = this.options.value + "%";

    this.element.addClass("progressbar").text( progress );

  }

});
```

The name of the plugin must contain a namespace; in this case we’ve used the `nmk` namespace.
There is a limitation that namespaces be exactly one level deep — that is, we can't use a namespace like `nmk.foo`.
We can also see that the widget factory has provided two properties for us. `this.element` is a jQuery object containing exactly one element.
If our plugin is called on a jQuery object containing multiple elements, a separate plugin instance will be created for each element, and each instance will have its own `this.element`.
The second property, `this.options`, is a hash containing key/value pairs for all of our plugin’s options.
These options can be passed to our plugin as shown here.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
### Note

In our example we use the `nmk` namespace. The `ui` namespace is reserved for official jQuery UI plugins. When building your own plugins, you should create your own namespace.
This makes it clear where the plugin came from and whether it is part of a larger collection.
</div>

Passing options to a widget
```
    $("<div></div>").appendTo( "body" ).progressbar({ value: 20 });
```

When we call `jQuery.widget `it extends jQuery by adding a method to `jQuery.fn` (the same way we'd create a standard plugin).
The name of the function it adds is based on the name you pass to `jQuery.widget`, without the namespace; in our case it will create `jQuery.fn.progressbar`.
The options passed to our plugin get set in `this.options` inside of our plugin instance.
As shown below, we can specify default values for any of our options.
When designing your API, you should figure out the most common use case for your plugin so that you can set appropriate default values and make all options truly optional.

```
Setting default options for a widget

$.widget( "nmk.progressbar", {

  // default options
  options: {

    value: 0

  },

  _create: function() {

    var progress = this.options.value + "%";

    this.element.addClass( "progressbar" ).text( progress );

  }

});
```

### Adding Methods to a Widget

Now that we can initialize our progress bar, we’ll add the ability to perform actions by calling methods on our plugin instance.
To define a plugin method, we just include the function in the object literal that we pass to `jQuery.widget`.
We can also define “private” methods by prepending an underscore to the function name.

Creating widget methods
```

$.widget( "nmk.progressbar", {
  options: {
    value: 0
  },

  _create: function() {

    var progress = this.options.value + "%";

    this.element.addClass("progressbar").text( progress );

  },

  // create a public method
  value: function( value ) {

    // no value passed, act as a getter
    if ( value === undefined ) {

      return this.options.value;

    // value passed, act as a setter
    } else {

      this.options.value = this._constrain( value );

      var progress = this.options.value + "%";

      this.element.text( progress );

    }

  },

  // create a private method
  _constrain: function( value ) {

    if ( value > 100 ) {

      value = 100;

    }

    if ( value < 0 ) {

      value = 0;

    }

    return value;

  }

});
```

To call a method on a plugin instance, you pass the name of the method to the jQuery plugin. If you are calling a method that accepts parameters, you simply pass those parameters after the method name.

Calling methods on a plugin instance
```
var bar = $("<div></div>").appendTo("body").progressbar({ value: 20 });

// get the current value
alert( bar.progressbar("value") );

// update the value
bar.progressbar( "value", 50 );

// get the current value again
alert( bar.progressbar("value") );
```

<div class="note" markdown="1">
### Note

Executing methods by passing the method name to the same jQuery function that was used to initialize the plugin may seem odd. This is done to prevent pollution of the jQuery namespace while maintaining the ability to chain method calls.
</div>

### Working with Widget Options

One of the methods that is automatically available to our plugin is the option method.
The option method allows you to get and set options after initialization.
This method works exactly like jQuery’s css and `attr` methods: you can pass just a name to use it as a setter, a name and value to use it as a single setter, or a hash of name/value pairs to set multiple values.
When used as a getter, the plugin will return the current value of the option that corresponds to the name that was passed in.
When used as a setter, the plugin’s `_setOption` method will be called for each option that is being set.
We can specify a `_setOption` method in our plugin to react to option changes.

Responding when an option is set
```
$.widget( "nmk.progressbar", {

  options: {

    value: 0

  },

  _create: function() {

    this.element.addClass("progressbar");

    this._update();

  },

  _setOption: function( key, value ) {

    this.options[ key ] = value;

    this._update();

  },

  _update: function() {

    var progress = this.options.value + "%";

    this.element.text( progress );

  }

});
```

### Adding Callbacks

One of the easiest ways to make your plugin extensible is to add callbacks so
users can react when the state of your plugin changes. We can see below how to
add a callback to our progress bar to signify when the progress has reached
100%. The `_trigger` method takes three parameters: the name of the callback,
a native event object that initiated the callback, and a hash of data relevant
to the event. The callback name is the only required parameter, but the others
can be very useful for users who want to implement custom functionality on top
of your plugin. For example, if we were building a draggable plugin, we could
pass the native mousemove event when triggering a drag callback; this would
allow users to react to the drag based on the x/y coordinates provided by the
event object.

Providing callbacks for user extension
```
$.widget( "nmk.progressbar", {

  options: {

    value: 0

  },

  _create: function() {

    this.element.addClass("progressbar");

    this._update();
  },

  _setOption: function( key, value ) {

    this.options[ key ] = value;

    this._update();
  },

  _update: function() {

    var progress = this.options.value + "%";

    this.element.text( progress );

    if ( this.options.value == 100 ) {

      this._trigger( "complete", null, { value: 100 } );

    }

  }

});
```

Callback functions are essentially just additional options, so you can get and
set them just like any other option. Whenever a callback is executed, a
corresponding event is triggered as well. The event type is determined by
concatenating the plugin name and the callback name. The callback and event
both receive the same two parameters: an event object and a hash of data
relevant to the event, as we’ll see below.

If your plugin has functionality that you want to allow the user to prevent,
the best way to support this is by creating cancelable callbacks. Users can
cancel a callback, or its associated event, the same way they cancel any native
event: by calling `event.preventDefault()` or using `return false`. If the user
cancels the callback, the `_trigger` method will return false so you can
implement the appropriate functionality within your plugin.

Binding to widget events
```
var bar = $("<div></div>").appendTo("body").progressbar({

    complete: function( event, data ) {

        alert("Callbacks are great!");

    }

}).bind( "progressbarcomplete", function( event, data ) {

  alert("Events bubble and support many handlers for extreme flexibility.");

  alert( "The progress bar value is " + data.value );

});

bar.progressbar( "option", "value", 100 );
```

### The Widget Factory: Under the Hood

When you call jQuery.widget, it creates a constructor function for your plugin and sets the object literal that you pass in as the prototype for your plugin instances. All of the functionality that automatically gets added to your plugin comes from a base widget prototype, which is defined as jQuery.Widget.prototype. When a plugin instance is created, it is stored on the original DOM element using jQuery.data, with the plugin name as the key.

Because the plugin instance is directly linked to the DOM element, you can access the plugin instance directly instead of going through the exposed plugin method if you want. This will allow you to call methods directly on the plugin instance instead of passing method names as strings and will also give you direct access to the plugin’s properties.

```
var bar = $("<div></div>")
  .appendTo("body")
  .progressbar()
  .data("progressbar");

// call a method directly on the plugin instance
bar.option( "value", 50 );

// access properties on the plugin instance
alert( bar.options.value );
```

One of the biggest benefits of having a constructor and prototype for a plugin
is the ease of extending the plugin. By adding or modifying methods on the
plugin’s prototype, we can modify the behavior of all instances of our plugin.
For example, if we wanted to add a method to our progress bar to reset the
progress to 0% we could add this method to the prototype and it would instantly
be available to be called on any plugin instance.

```
$.nmk.progressbar.prototype.reset = function() {

  this._setOption( "value", 0 );

};
```

### Cleaning Up

In some cases, it will make sense to allow users to apply and then later
unapply your plugin. You can accomplish this via the destroy method. Within the
`destroy` method, you should undo anything your plugin may have done during
initialization or later use. The `destroy` method is automatically called if the
element that your plugin instance is tied to is removed from the DOM, so this
can be used for garbage collection as well. The default `destroy` method removes
the link between the DOM element and the plugin instance, so it’s important to
call the base function from your plugin’s `destroy` method.

Adding a destroy method to a widget
```
$.widget( "nmk.progressbar", {

  options: {

    value: 0

  },

  _create: function() {

    this.element.addClass("progressbar");

    this._update();

  },

  _setOption: function( key, value ) {

    this.options[ key ] = value;

    this._update();

  },

  _update: function() {

    var progress = this.options.value + "%";

    this.element.text( progress );

    if ( this.options.value === 100 ) {

      this._trigger( "complete", null, { value: 100 } );

    }

  },

  destroy: function() {

    this.element
      .removeClass("progressbar")
      .text("");

    // call the base destroy function
    $.Widget.prototype.destroy.call( this );

  }

});
```

### Conclusion

The widget factory is only one way of creating stateful plugins. There are a
few different models that can be used and each have their own advantages and
disadvantages. The widget factory solves lots of common problems for you and
can greatly improve productivity, it also greatly improves code reuse, making
it a great fit for jQuery UI as well as many other stateful plugins.
