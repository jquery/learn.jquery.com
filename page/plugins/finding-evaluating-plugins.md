One of the most celebrated aspects of jQuery is its extensive plugin ecosystem. From table sorting to form validation to autocompletion â€“ if there's a need for it, chances are good that someone has written a plugin for it.

The quality of jQuery plugins varies widely. Many plugins are extensively tested and well-maintained, but others are hastily created and then ignored. More than a few fail to follow best practices. Some plugins, mainly [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/), are maintained by the jQuery team. The quality of these plugins is as good as jQuery itself.

The easiest way to find plugins is to search Google or the [jQuery Plugins Registry](http://plugins.jquery.com/). Once you've identified some options, you may want to consult the [jQuery forums](http://forum.jquery.com/) or the `#jquery` IRC channel to get input from others.

When looking for a plugin to fill a need, do your homework. Ensure that the plugin is well-documented, and look for the author to provide lots of examples of its use. Be wary of plugins that do far more than you need; they can end up adding substantial overhead to your page. For more tips on spotting a sub-par plugin, read [Signs of a poorly written jQuery plugin](http://remysharp.com/2010/06/03/signs-of-a-poorly-written-jquery-plugin/) by Remy Sharp.

Once you choose a plugin, you'll need to add it to your page. Download the plugin, unzip it if necessary, place it your application's directory structure, then include the plugin in your page using a script tag (after you include jQuery).
